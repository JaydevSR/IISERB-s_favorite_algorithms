## Contribution guidelines:

1. Add your favorite algorithm in your favorite language to `algorithms/` folder.
2. Add a description/explaination of that algorithm below.

## Algorithms

### Example Algorithm

Name: Saunov Abish

This is the description of example algorithm. Add your algorithms **below** (Please maintain alphabetical order)


### Bellman-Ford Algorithm

Name : Kumar Katyayan Jaiswal

**Link to File**: https://github.com/JaydevSR/IISERB-s_favorite_algorithms/blob/main/algorithms/bellman_ford.py

Implementation of the Bellman-Ford algorithm in python. 

Running the python file returns the Minimum Spanning Tree obtained by implementing the algorithm on a directed graph. In order calculate the Vertex distance from the Source vertex, just the add the weights of all the edges in the path from the source vertex to the Vertex.
